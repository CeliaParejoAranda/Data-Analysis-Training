This is a program I created so that studying English vocabulary and common expressions for my C1 exam 
was more exciting. It makes use of a csv file called 'voc' which contains words or phrases in your 
mother tongue (if Spanish) and in English, each pair or words in one line, separated by a comma, and 
you can choose if you wish to translate from English to Spanish, or viceversa.

You start having three 'lives'. Each time you make a mistake, you are given a second opportunity and a 
hint (first letter of the asked word or phrase). If you make a second mistake, you lose one life. If 
you guess 5 words on a roll, you are rewarded with an extra life. Needless to say, the goal of this 
game is to spell all the words from your csv file correctly. 

An the best part: it works!
