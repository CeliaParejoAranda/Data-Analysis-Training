This is a program I created so that memorizing English vocabulary and common expressions for my C1 exam 
was more exciting. It makes use of a csv file called 'voc' which contains words or phrases in your mother 
tongue (if Spanish) and in English, each pair of words in one line, separated by a comma. At the beggining 
of the game, you are told to choose wether you wish to translate from Spanish to English, or viceversa.

You start having three 'lives' (attempts). Each time you make a mistake, you are firstly given a second 
opportunity and a hint (first letter of the asked word or phrase). If you make a second mistake, then you 
lose one life. On the other hand, if you guess 5 words on a roll, you are rewarded with an extra life. 
Needless to say, the goal of this game is to spell all the words from your csv file correctly, as it will 
mean that you have managed to learn them.

An the best part: it works!
