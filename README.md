# Data-Analysis-and-coding-Training
Hi, this is my Data Analysis Training (and other coding works) portfolio. 
It includes:
- A Data Cleaning + EDA project about 911 calls
- An EDA + Machine Learning project about white wines quality
- A program (game) for studying vocabulary or expressions in English (previously written in a csv file)
- An exercise I did during my current master, which is a sort of basic sentiment analysis of tweets, without machine learning
