# Data-Analysis-and-coding-Training
Hi, this is my Data Analysis Training (and other coding works) portfolio. 
Up until now, it includes:
- An exercise I did during my current master, which is a sort of basic sentiment analysis of tweets without machine learning 
- A program (game) for studying vocabulary or expressions in English (previously written in a csv file). Please take a look at the README file for a deeper explanation 
- A Data Cleaning + EDA project about 911 calls 
- An EDA + Machine Learning project about white wines quality 
- An EDA + Machine Learning project about myopia development in children 

Feel free to explore them! These projects are listed following the order in which they have been done, in case you only wish to browse the most recent ones

Have a nice day,

Celia
