# Data-Analysis-and-coding-Training
Hi, this is my Data Analysis Training (and other coding works) portfolio. 
Up until now, it includes:
- An exercise I did during my current master, which is a sort of basic sentiment analysis of tweets without machine learning (1)
- A program (game) for studying vocabulary or expressions in English (previously written in a csv file) (2)
- A Data Cleaning + EDA project about 911 calls (3)
- An EDA + Machine Learning project about white wines quality (4)

Feel free to explore them! The numbers indicate the order in which these projects have been done, in case you only wish to browse the most recent ones
